#NEURALNETWORK

I have tried to implement a neural network on what I have learned in the class on the MNIST digit dataset. Tried classifying the digits, first without hidden layer and then with hidden layer.

#WORD2VEC

In the class lectures, I have learned various things about Word2Vec. Hence, tried it several times.

In the Gensim analogies, I have tried to capture various similarities and analogies between words using glove wiki data.

Similarly, using another dataset of reviews, I have implemented Word2Vec and seen similarity score between different words.
